# How to Add a PO to a Delivery

1) Get the PO number and delivery number.
2) Go to **Scheduler**
3) Enter the delivery in the search box at the top <sup>1</sup>
4) Click the delivery that comes up
5) On the page for the delivery, click the `Modify` button
6) Make sure the delivery status is `DROP`, not `LIVE`
    - If `LIVE`, it is an appointment. Do not manually add POs to appointments
      without being given the okay from Traffic/Management/Etc. <sup>2</sup>
7) If `DROP`, then go to the `Details` tab, and click the `Add PO` button
8) Scroll down to the bottom of the list of POs, and put the PO number
   in the empty box for the new PO
   - Repeat steps 7 & 8 for any additional POs you want to add.
9) Click the `Complete` button to finish adding the PO <sup>3</sup>

&nbsp;

Notes:

<sup>1</sup>
You can also search with the PO number, but this will list every delivery
the PO is on. Do whatever is easier at the time.

<sup>2</sup>
If you know a PO needs to go on an appointment, please go to any of the
senior exceptions clerks and let then know traffic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to be contacted
about the PO.
- For A2: go to Mike, or Chris if Mike is not available.

<sup>3</sup>
IF DC-side is down, then the PO will be added, but the effects will not 
kick in until it comes back up around 11:30.

&nbsp;

# To verify and ensure your added PO should work

1) Go to DC-side
2) Go to the `GUAM` screen
3) Enter your initials and delivery you want to look at
   - If you just added a PO, it will take a minute to load the changes
4) Once the delivery is loaded, look for the PO you added at the bottom
   of the PO list
    - If you do not see it, then press `F2` to go to the next page of POs;
      if you still do not see the PO, keep pressing `F2` until you reach
      the end of the PO list
5) Look at the receivers on the right side of the list and see if the PO(s)
   you added have a receiver come up <sup>1</sup>
6) If the receiver comes up, go to `RDS`
7) Go into the delivery on `RDS`
8) Search for the PO you wanted to add
9) If the PO pops up, then it should be working <sup>2</sup>
    - It may take another minute after coming up in `GUAM` to come up in
      `RDS`, and a little longer to come up in `GLS`
10) To be really sure, check if the items you need come up and print in `GLS`
    <sup>2</sup>

Notes:

<sup>1</sup>
If the receiver does not come up, it may be too old or there may be some
other issue with it. Any senior exceptions clerk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be able to help
you figure out what needs to be done.

<sup>2</sup>
Note that changes coming up in `RDS` does not guarantee they will also
pop up at the same time in `GLS`; it may take a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while, or refuse to come
up in `GLS`.
- If some changes still are not coming up after a day or so, there may be
  some underlying issue. See any senior exceptions clerk for help; they may
  need to be manually received in `RDS`.
